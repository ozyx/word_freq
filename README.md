# word_freq
count the word frequency in a text file... in Rust!

to build:
`cargo build`

to run:
`word_freq <filename>`

or simply

`cargo run <filename>`

make sure to output to a text file so you can see the results, as they are pretty long and might overflow terminal buffer
`cargo run <filename> > out.txt`
